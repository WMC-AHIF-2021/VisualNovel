Scene: Bedroom
hm..I slowly awoke from my sleep. I was still a little tired, but I had the feeling as if something was off.
Looking at my surroundings I realized that I wasn't in my bedroom, but rather in an odd-looking one. The room was more or less
empty, the only furniture being the bed i woke up in and a shelve beside the window. There is dust and spiderwebs everywhere and the
walls are dirty. A part of me thought that I was just imagining things, but after a while of getting fully awake I
started to become a bit worried. Is nobody here? I suddenly heard a strange noise coming from downstairs.
Scene: Kitchen
I rushed down the stairs to find myself in an kitchen-like area.Thats when i noticed something crawling on top of one of
the counters. How did i get here over night and why is there a weird round monster with wings? There is an old frypan on
one of the counters. I could try to attack it, or is it better to try and communicate with it?
A: Attack it / B: Try to communicate
B: I tried to get closer to it, when it suddenly launched at me and bit my right arm "arghhhh".I panicked. Why is this happening?
Seconds later someone else rushed into the house and knocked the creature out.
???(Vita)
"Are you okay? I heard screaming."
MC
"The thing bit me. Do you have anything to stop the bleeding?"
He reached into his bag and took out some bandeges.
???
"Here have these"
MC
I took the bandages and wrapped them arround my right arm.
"Thank you for saving me. Do you perhaps know where we are and where i can find other people?"
???(Vita)
"Oh, did you get lost? Well i don't know the name of this place, but if you are searching for the village it should be somewhere in the west.
How did you even end up in a place like this?"
Mc
Should I tell him that i suddenly woke up in this place without knowing where I am?
I mean he just saved me and might be able to help me out, so why not.
"I actually dont't know that myself. I woke up in this abonded house without any memories of my past"
???(Vita)
"What?!Thats terrible. Do you have a place to stay? If you want I can bring you to where me and some others live."
MC
I dont really know what to say, but its probably the best option I have, especially becaus he can fight and who knows how many of those little beasts are out
there, just waiting to attack me.
"hmm..its good for start to get somewhere safe and get the bite treated, so i will gladly accept your offer. I really can't thank you enough"
???
"its no problem, you' are welcome. Come on let's get going"
Scene: Landschaft
MC
While walking out of the house with vita i noticed that there where more destroyed buildings. How did I end up in a
place like this? Did i hurt my head or someone kidnapped me and brought me here?
???(Vita)
"Come to think of it..we havent exchanged names yet, have we? The name's Vita, what about you? Or do you also not remember your name?"
MC
"My name..what was my name again?Oh!Now I remember its {name}!By the way, how long are we going to be walking?Also can you maybe tell me
a bit about this world?"
Vita
"Sure i can do that. You should know, that there are monster, like that thing from before, humans and half-monsters in this world.
What makes us half-monsters different form normal ones, is that they have some human features. Most of them are staying at a shelter,
a place in the woods. Thats also the location we are heading to. I probably should have informed you earlier that you arent going to find 
any humans there, but a lot of people like me."
Mc
"Don't worry, as long as there is nobody whos going to attack me i will be fine."
Vita
"Yeah it shouldnt be a big deal for them, if someone stays for a while. Maybe they will be a bit sceptical at first, but the most are nice people, trust me.
I'm sorry that i can't take you to the human village, but its better for me its better to not get involved with them. Humans and monster are at war, so you should
better stay away from both sides, but of course you can feel free do whatever you want and go to the village. I just wanted to warn you.
Oh looks like we are here. Just walk into the woods. There should be a huge base. You want something to eat?"

Mc
