Scene: Bedroom
I slowly awoke from my sleep. I was still a little tired, but I had a feeling that something was off.
Looking at my surroundings I realized that I wasn't in my bedroom, but rather in an odd-looking one. The room was more or less
empty, the only furniture being the bed I woke up in and a shelf beside the window. It is dusty, and spiderwebs are everywhere. The
walls are dirty. A part of me thought I was just imagining things, but after a bit I was fully awake, and I
started to become even more worried. Is nobody here? I suddenly heard a strange noise coming from downstairs.

Scene: Kitchen
I rushed down the stairs to find myself in a kitchen-like area. I kept wondering: "How did I get here overnight?", but that's when I noticed something
crawling on top of one of the counters. It's a round creature with wings and large teeth at the bottom of its face. There is an old fry pan on
one of the counters. I could attack it, but maybe I should try to communicate with it?
A: Attack it / B: Try to communicate
B: I tried to get closer to it when it suddenly launched at me and bit my right arm. "AAAAAHH", I screamed in pain. I panicked. Why is this happening to me?
Seconds later someone else ran into the house and knocked the creature out.
???(Vita)
"Are you okay? I heard screaming."
MC
"The thing bit me. Do you have anything to stop the bleeding?"
He reached into his bag and took out some bandages.
???
"Here, have these."
MC
I took the bandages and wrapped them around my right arm.
"Thank you for saving me. Do you perhaps know where we are and where I can find other people?"
???(Vita)
"Oh, did you get lost? Well I don't know the name of this place, but if you are searching for the village it should be somewhere in the west.
How did you even end up in a place like this?"
Mc
Should I tell him that I suddenly woke up in this place without knowing where I am?
I mean he just saved me and might be able to help me out, so why not.
"I actually don't know that myself. I woke up in this abounded house without any memories of my past"
???(Vita)
"What?!That's terrible. Do you have a place to stay? If you want I can bring you to where me and some others live."
MC
I don't really know what to say, but it's probably the best option I have, especially because he can fight and who knows how many of those little beasts are out
there, just waiting to attack me.
"hmm..its good for start to get somewhere safe and get the bite treated, so i will gladly accept your offer. I really can't thank you enough"
???
"it's no problem, you' are welcome. Come on let's get going"

Scene: Landscape
MC
While walking out of the house with vita i noticed that there were more destroyed buildings. How did I end up in a
place like this? Did i hurt my head or someone kidnapped me and brought me here?
???(Vita)
"Come to think of it..we haven't exchanged names yet, have we? The name's Vita, what about you? Or do you also not remember your name?"
MC
"My name..what was my name again? Oh! Now I remember. It's {name}!By the way, how long are we going to be walking? Also, can you maybe tell me
a bit about this world?"
Vita
"Sure i can do that. You should know, that there are monster, like that thing from before, humans and half-monsters in this world.
What makes us half-monsters different form normal ones, is that they have some human features. Most of them are staying at a shelter,
a place in the woods. That's also the location we are heading to. I probably should have informed you earlier that you aren't going to find
any humans there, but a lot of people like me."
Mc
"Don't worry, as long as there is nobody who's going to attack me I will be fine."
Vita
"Yeah it shouldn't be a big deal for them, if someone stays for a while. Maybe they will be a bit sceptical at first, but the most are nice people, trust me.
I'm sorry that i can't take you to the human village, but it's better for me not get involved with them. Humans and monster are at war, so you should
better stay away from both sides, but of course you can feel free to do whatever you want and go to the village. I just wanted to warn you.
Oh, looks like we are here. Just walk into the woods. There should be a huge base."

Scene: Shelter
Mc
Me and the stranger named Vita entered the forest. He was greeting some of the others who lived here.There where actually lots of other people.I didnt expect so many to be here.
There were some small buildings, tents and actually much free space.
Vita
"This place may not be the most comfortable one, but it has its benefits. Hey,how about we introduce you to our leader?"
MC
We went to the direction their so-called leader was at. Do those others really not mind me? Many are looking at me as if i was some kind of villain.
Vita stopped walking in front of three creatures that looked as if they were discussing something. When they were finished two of them walked away,
while the one that stayed turned to us. She is tall, has black and white skin and two long horns as well as a deer-like horn growing out of her forehead.
???(Steak)
"Can I help you with something Vita? I see you brought someone else here."She turned to look at me for a few seconds with curious eyes. Then she turned her gaze back to Vita.
Vita
"Well I stumbled across {pronouns} in an abounded village.{pronouns} name is {McName}. {pronouns} said that {pronouns} suddenly woke up in one of the houses and claims to have no memories of {pronouns} past. So I decided to bring {pronouns} here. I hope that's alright with you"
???(Steak)
"Ah, don't worry. I don't mind more people staying here."
Then she turned to look at me.
"I am Steak, It's nice to meet you. If you have any questions or need help with something just come to me or Vita. We will be happy to be of help." Steak gave me a warm smile. "Hold on, Vita said you lost your memories, right?I hope that doesn't trouble you too much. If you don't mind me asking, what do you plan to do, now that you are here in another world?"
MC
What I plan to do? I haven't really thought of that. Of course, I want to go home, but not remembering anything is also scary thought. What if my previous life was
actually horrible? Suddenly the image of the round creature flashed before me eyes. It was actually pretty creepy and there are probably worse living beings here.
Just thinking of it made a shiver run down my spine. So what am i going to answer?

If bitten:
: Suddenly I felt an aching pain in my head. It hurt so much that i couldn't think clear. Slowly my sight started to fate and..

Black screen

I opened my eyes to see that I was laying on a mattress in a big tent. There were also others in the tent, who didn't look to well also laying on mattresses. What happened? Wasn't I just talking with Steak?That's when a funny looking, tiny, old creature came into the tent, who's probably the doctor.
Scene: Shelter

Doctor
"Oho I see you are finally awake. Steak brought you here after you passed out. We took a look at your wound and treated it. It shouldn't be a big deal. Now if you could please wait for a moment. The doctor went outside again.
After some minutes the doctor cam back in with Steak.
Steak
"How are you feeling? Does anything hurt?"
Mc
"No, at least not at the moment."
Steak
"I'm glad you're well. Oh, and about what I asked you before. Don't feel commited to answer that. The reason why I asked you about it, was because
I am very curious and like to know more about others. Yet you can still tell me if you want to. Well enough of the chit chat, why don't I show you to where you 
will be sleeping?"
Mc
"Uhmm yeah sure"
We got out of the big tent and went to the sleeping area.
Steak
"So, that's the place where we all sleep.You will be sleeping in the tent over there" She pointed at the tent. " There will be an old blanket as well as a pillow. Make yourself comfortable. I will be leaving for now. Bye"
Mc
"yawn" Even though I was asleep until a few minutes ago I am already tired again. What can i say it was a long day. I went into the tent and layed down. What an eventfully day. Why did I wake up in an abounded village?
What happened to my memories? Well at least I have somewhere to stay. I can't stop thinking about what will await me tomorrow.

the next morning...

Mc
I suddenly woke up, when hearing a pretty loud scream.
"Hey traveller! It's time to wake up!"
Mc
*groan* "Who is waking me up this early in the morning?" I got up from my mattress and went out of the tent.
I saw Steak standing outside. So she was the one who woke me up.

Steak
"Finally you're awake!Come on lets get breakfast."
She leads me to the area where everyone was eating. There were baskets of different berries and fruits, bread and more.
There are different foods growing on fields, some people are collecting berries.
I just grabbed an apple and we went to the table Vita was sitting at.
We greated one another and then me and Steak sat down.
While eating Steak suddenly spoke up. "You know I have been thinking, why don't we pay the human village a visit? Maybe they know whats up with your mysterious case."
When Vita heard what Steak said, he choked on the milk he wa currently drinking.
Vita
"Go to the human village?! Are you crazy?! What if they try something weird, or they accuse us of kidnapping {McName}?You know they aren't reliable"
Vita didn't like that idea at all.
Steak
Steak had to chuckle a little."haha. Come on Vita don't be like that! Who knows maybe they can help us out?"
Vita still wasn't pleased with the idea.
Mc
"I guess it's worth a try. Let's do it"

Scene: Human village
Mc
We went to the human village to ask them for advice.
Passing through the village people gave us weird looks.
Steak
"Lets search for the leader quickly"
After some time the leader came to us.
Human leader
"What are you three doing in our village?"
Steak started to speak up.
"We came here, because we found {McName} and they don't have any memories of their past. Maybe you guys recognise them or know something about it."
Human
"I don't think we are missing anybody. If you want
