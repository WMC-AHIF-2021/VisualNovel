            <p>
              In this story, the player finds themselves in an unknown world.
              There they meet their first companion, Vita, who is part of an
              organisation called "Shelter". What's unique about this world is
              the existence of monsters. They are at war with humans. "Shelter"
              is a group of half-human, half-monster creatures that don't fit in
              either group, and most of them joined "Shelter" to try and find
              peace between the two. The player has to choose what to do, who to
              trust, and how to get back to their own world.

                <p>
                  The human village is located in the southwest. There humans
                  live in small tents and buildings. Some of them are afraid of
                  the monsters, but most are determined to fight against them.
                  They even caught some of them and use them against their own
                  kind. From the outside the village seems pretty peaceful, but
                  there have gone some strange rumors around.

                  For some reason these creatures hold a grudge against humans.
                  Most are very aggressive towards them. They have a king and
                  their home is up in the mountains in the north.

                  Shelter is an organisation for the half-monster who don't want
                  to be involved in the war. They have a leader named Steak.
                  Many half-monsters are neutral to humans and monsters and mind
                  their own business. Some dislike the humans, or just certain
                  ones. Shelter is located in a forest in the east.
