It is dusty, and spiderwebs are everywhere. The walls are dirty. A part of me thought I was just imagining things, but after a bit i was fully awake and I started to become even more worried.; Is nobody here?

Do you have anything to stop the bleeding?\";He reached into his bag and took out some bandages.\"Here, have these.;\"I took the bandages and wrapped them around my right arm.;\"Thank you for saving me.

Well I don't know the name of this place, but if you are searching for the village it should be somewhere in the west.\nHow did you even end up in a place like this?;\"Should I tell him that I suddenly woke up in this place without knowing where I am?

Why don't you stay with me and some others for a while?; \"That would be great! Its really nice of you to offer me something like that.\"Somewhere to take shelter would really be good for a start.

Did i hurt my head or someone kidnapped me and brought me here?

Or do you also not remember your name?;\"\"My name..what was my name again? Oh! Now I remember. It's {McName}!By the way, how long are we going to be walking? Also, can you maybe tell me a bit about this world?\";\"Sure i can do that. You should know, that there are monster, like that thing from before, humans and half-monsters in this world.What makes us half-monsters different form normal ones, is that they have some human features. Most of them are staying at a shelter,a place in the woods.; That's also the location we are heading to. I probably should have informed you earlier that you aren't going to find any humans there, but a lot of people like me.\";\"Don't worry, as long as there is nobody who's going to attack me I will be fine.\";\"Yeah it shouldn't be a big deal for them, if someone stays for a while. Maybe they will be a bit sceptical at first, but the most are nice people, trust me.; I'm sorry that i can't take you to the human village, but it's better for me not get involved with them. Humans and monster are at war, so you should better stay away from both sides, but of course you can feel free to do whatever you want and go to the village.; I just wanted to warn you. Oh, looks like we are here. Just walk into the woods. There should be a huge base.\"",

      "text":"Me and the stranger named Vita entered the forest. He was greeting some of the others who lived here.;There where actually lots of other people.I didnt expect so many to be here.There were some small buildings, tents and actually much free space.;\"This place may not be the most comfortable one, but it has its benefits. Hey,how about we introduce you to our leader?\";We went to the direction their so-called leader was at. Do those others really not mind me? Many are looking at me as if i was some kind of villain.;Vita stopped walking in front of three creatures that looked as if they were discussing something. When they were finished two of them walked away,while the one that stayed turned to us.; She is tall, has dark and white skin and two long horns as well as a deer-like horn growing out of her forehead.;\"Can I help you with something Vita? I see you brought someone else here.\"She turned to look at me for a few seconds with curious eyes. Then she turned her gaze back to Vita.;\"Well I stumbled across {pronouns} in an abounded village.{pronouns} name is {McName}. {pronouns} said that {pronouns} suddenly woke up in one of the houses and claims to have no memories of {pronouns} past.; So I decided to bring {pronouns} here. I hope that's alright with you\";\"Ah, don't worry. I don't mind more people staying here.;\"Then she turned to look at me.\"I am Steak, It's nice to meet you. If you have any questions or need help with something just come to me or Vita. We will be happy to be of help.\"; Steak gave me a warm smile. \"Hold on, Vita said you lost your memories, right?I hope that doesn't trouble you too much. If you don't mind me asking, what do you plan to do, now that you are here in another world?;\"What I plan to do? I haven't really thought of that. Of course, I want to go home, but not remembering anything is also scary thought. What if my previous life was actually horrible? ;Suddenly the image of the round creature flashed before me eyes. It was actually pretty creepy and there are probably worse living beings here.Just thinking of it made a shiver run down my spine. So what am i going to answer?",
