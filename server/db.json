I was still a little tired, but I had a feeling that something was off.Looking at my surroundings I realized that I wasn't in my bedroom, but rather in an odd-looking one.; The room was more or less empty, the only furniture being the bed i woke up in and a shelve beside the window. It is dusty, and spiderwebs are everywhere. The walls are dirty. A part of me thought I was just imagining things, but after a bit i was fully awake and I started to become even more worried.; Is nobody here? I suddenly heard a strange noise coming from downstairs.",
