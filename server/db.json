It is dusty, and spiderwebs are everywhere. The walls are dirty. A part of me thought I was just imagining things, but after a bit i was fully awake and I started to become even more worried.; Is nobody here?

The name's Vita, what about you? Or do you also forget your name?;\"\"My name..what was my name again? Oh! I remember. It's [! By the way, could you maybe tell me a bit about this world?\";\"Sure i can do that. You should know that there are monsters like that thing from before, humans, and half-monsters in this world. What makes us hybrids different from normal monsters are the human features. Most of us half-monster are staying in a shelter in the woods.; That's also the location we're heading to. I probably should have informed you earlier that you aren't going to find any humans there, but there will be a lot of people like me.\";\"Don't worry, as long as there is nobody who's going to attack me I will be fine.\";\"Yeah, it shouldn't be a big deal for them if you stay for a while. They might be a bit sceptical at first, but most of them are nice people, trust me.; I'm sorry that I can't take you to the human village, but it's better for me not get involved with them. Humans and monster are at war, so you should probably stay away from both, but you can feel free to do whatever you want of course, even if it's going to the village.; I just wanted to warn you. Oh, looks like we are here. Just walk in there. You should see a huge base.\"",

There were some small buildings, tents and actually a lot of free space.;\"This place may not be the most comfortable one, but it has its benefits. How about I introduce you to our leader first?\";We went to the direction their so-called leader was at. Do those others really not mind me? Many are looking at me as if i was some kind of villain.;Vita stopped walking when we arrived near three creatures that looked like they were discussing something. After they were done, two of them walked away while the one that stayed turned to us.; She was tall, her skin was split in half with one being white and the other being black. Two long horns as well as a deer-like one were growing out of her head.;\"Do you need something, Vita? I see you brought someone here.\"She turned to look at me for a few seconds with curious eyes. Then she averted her gaze back to Vita.;\"Well, I stumbled across a human in an abandoned village, } name is [. [ said that { suddenly woke up in one of the houses and claims to have no memories of } past.; So I decided to bring [ here. I hope that's alright with you?\";\"Yeah, don't worry. I don't mind more people staying here.;\"Then she turned to look at me more precisely.\"I am Steak, nice to meet you. If you have any questions or need help with something you can just come to me or Vita. We'll be happy to be of help.\"; Steak gave me a warm smile. \"Vita said you lost your memories, right? I hope that doesn't trouble you too much. If you don't mind me asking, what do you plan to do?;\"What I plan to do? I haven't really thought of that. Of course, I want to go home, but not remembering anything is scary. What if my previous life was actually horrible? ;Suddenly, the image of the round creature flashed before me eyes. It was actually pretty creepy and there are probably worse living beings here. Just thinking of it made a shiver run down my spine. So what am i going to answer?",
