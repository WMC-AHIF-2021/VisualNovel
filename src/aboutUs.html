        <h2>The Website</h2>
        <p>
          This is a none-profit Website, created by three students of the HTL Leonding. We chose to make this Website, because we wanted to make something creative and new. In this game we wanted to create our own
          characters and story. At first, we had to think of a good, interesting story. We also had to make different paths for the story
          to take, which was hard, because every path has to get a fitting ending. Still it was much fun to create the story and an interesting
          experience.

                Hey!<br>
                I am Mia Marčeta, almost sixteen years old and a student of the HTL Leonding B).
                When I am older, I want to make a lot of money. My task is to correct spelling mistakes.
                I also did a lot of the artwork, such as Vita or the map. Some of my hobbies include drawing, playing
                Cookie Run: Ovenbreak and watching cartoons.<br>
