        <h2>About the Website</h2>
        <p>
          We chose to make this Website, because we wanted to make something creative and new. In this game we wanted to create our own
          characters and story. At first, we had to think of a good, interesting story. We also had to make different paths for the story
          to take, which was hard, because every path has to get a fitting ending. Still it was much fun to create the story and an interesting
          experience.
