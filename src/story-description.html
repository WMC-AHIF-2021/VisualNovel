                    <p>In this story, the player finds themselves in an unknown world. There they meet their first companion, Vita, who is part of an organisation called "Shelter". What's unique about this world is the existence of monsters. They are at
                        war with humans. "Shelter" is a group of half-human, half-monster creatures that don't fit in either group, and most of them joined "Shelter" to try and find peace between the two. The player has to choose what to do, who to trust,
                        and how to get back to their own world.</p>

                        Shelter is a organisation for the half-monster who don't want to be involved in the war.
                        They have a leader named Steak.
                        Many half-monsters are neutral to humans and monsters and mind their own buisness.
                        Some dislike the humans, or just certain ones.
                        Shelter is located in a forest in the east.
