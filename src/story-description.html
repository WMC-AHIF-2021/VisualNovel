                <p>In this story, the player finds themselves in an unknown world. There they meet their first companion, Vita, who is part of an organisation called "Shelter". What's unique about this world is the existence of monsters. They are at war
                    with humans. "Shelter" is a group of half-human, half-monster creatures that don't fit in either group, and most of them joined "Shelter" to try and find peace between the two. The player has to choose what to do, who to trust, and
                    how to get back to their own world.</p>
