      <h2>Meaning of "Visual Novel"</h2>
      <p>
        Visual novels are games which often get described as 'interactive books'. The player can decide
        between
        different decisions
        which all lead to different endings of the game. They mostly get played in Japan, which is also the
        origin of these games.
        70% of the PC games released in Japan in 2006, are visual novels. In Japan, there is a difference
        made
        between the novel-part
        and the adventure-part in the visual novel. The novel-part consists mostly of the story and very few
        interactive parts.
        On the other hand, the adventure-part has more of the problem-solving and active gameplay.

      <h2>The early years: Adventure games and Manga</h2>
      <p>Because adventure games were
        basically a string of puzzles for the player to solve, their design necessitated a holistic
        where every aspect of the game worked toward the same end. The narrative, for instance, had to
        contextualize whatever puzzles the
        player encountered, defining the logic in a
        consistent enough way that the player could reasonably solve them. Otherwise, the player wouldn't
        be equipped to handle
        the challenges they encounter later in the game. Unsurprisingly, this design shows up throughout
        Portopia, where the player analyzes a crime scene for
        clues that will advance the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>While visual
        novels would slowly fade out puzzle-oriented design in favor of narrative, all of their other
        structures
        remained
        intact, including their visuals. Admittedly, games like Portopia, Famicom Tantei Club, and
        Mindseeker
        used the same sprite on
        background approach that visual novels are known for today. So until that time, early visual
        novels largely employed a strategy
        that eschewed sprites altogether. Like manga, each panel was composed as a whole, its angles and
        shapes
        and other visual elements
        coming together to create a very specific scene or convey a particular mood.
      </p>
      <p>In any case, the art for both of these games wouldn't
        allow the narrative strategies that later visual novels employ. So rather than swap assets
        between scenes like later visual novels would,
        early visual novels instead relate individual shots to each other in sequential order, much like
        manga.
        While this doesn't
        necessarily lead early visual novels toward manga-esque narrative strategies, the art these games
        used
        certainly does. Because their art was so
        rigid, it only made sense to relate them to
        each other like manga panels.
      </p>
      <p>So when we look at early visual novels, we see them employing the same kinds of panel
        transitions that comics and manga had been comfortable using for years. Panel transitions
        aren't the only strategy early visual novels borrow from manga. Subjective motion lines show
        up in Dennou Tenshi at the bottom, and both
        manga and visual novels represent movement in similar ways, albeit for different reasons. Yet out of
        all
        the techniques
        early visual novels borrowed from manga, panel
        transitions have proven the most useful.
      </p>
      <p>Those choices
        determining which girl your character becomes linked with romantically, and thus which narrative
        thread
        the player
        follows. The most important
        influence was how that gameplay affected Tokimeki's visuals, and how those visuals would influence
        the art
        in later visual novels.
        Because the game lets the player take any girl to any location in the game, the old strategy of
        composing shots for
        specific scenes just wasn't feasible. So unable to create distinct
        images for every situation the player could encounter, Konami instead decided to compile generic
        assets that could be swapped out depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>Where previous
        visual novels could only muster a few different expressions per shot, Tokimeki's sprites allowed
        Konami to
        create as many as six expressions per character . Many writers have compared
        this to watching anime or reading manga. Those writers aren't
        wrong, but I think visual novels are better
        understood as stage productions. The trade-off from this
        arrangement is that while visual novels can no long frame a scene to create a specific effect, they
        encourage the player to approach the
        narrative in a way early visual novels didn't.
      </p>
      <p>It's
        because things are only suggested that the player has the space they need to put the story together
        as
        they see fit. Far from
        watching a narrative passively unfold before them, the player becomes an active participant in
        it, filling in the gaps that either the story
        or the visuals leave blank.
        It's up to the player to use the combined text and visuals to interpret what they're
        seeing. This isn't to
        say that later visual novels haven't experimented with their form.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, some visual novels really do feel like watching
        an anime or reading a novel.
        Yet both within individual games and in the genre at large, manga shots are the exception, not the
        rule.
        Theatrics remain the dominant
        mode of communication for the modern visual novel.
