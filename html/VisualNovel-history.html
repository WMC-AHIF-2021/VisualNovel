                <h2>Meaning of 'Visual Novel'</h2>
                <p>
                    Visual novels are games which often get described as 'interactive books'. The player can decide between different desicions
                    which all lead to different endings of the game. They mostly get played in Japan, which is also the origin of these games.
                    70% of the PC games released in Japan in 2006, are visual novels. In Japan, there is a difference made between the novel-part
                    and the adventure-part in the visual novel. The novel-part consists mostly of the story and very few interactive parts. On the other hand, the 
                    adventure-part has more of the problem sloving and active gameplay.
