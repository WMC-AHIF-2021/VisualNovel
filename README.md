# Visual Novel

As our project we want to create a website about a non-existent game. As the interactive part, we want to start really creating that game. It will have a small story and the player will be able to change it, for example: The person, who the game will be about, can choose either to go home or to go to the park and if the player chooses the park the story will take a different turn than when going home gets chosen.
